Workflow:
1. Start with the manual page (man page) and --help option for internsctl.
2. Developed scripts for CPU and memory information retrieval (easy level).
3. Proceed to user management commands (intermediate level).
4. Lastly, implement the file information command with options (advanced level).
Remember, for creating users, listing users, and file operations, administrative privileges might be needed, so make sure to handle permissions accordingly within the script.
